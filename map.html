          <p>People working for the local City Council and conscious citizens have the latest information on what is happening in a city and where are the areas where people might have certain behaviors.
            This information will help inform the companies providing Autonomous Vehicles in the same areas.
            They can take better decisions services and in a city by providing:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Real-time alerts about potential hazards could be sent to multiple stakeholders - civil society organizations,
              the local municipality, the manufacturing company, teams within the National Transportation Safety Board. </li>
            <li>Highly annotationed maps of specific risk areas.
              Each area might require different parameters for the AI systems
              used for controlling the driving behavior of the vehicle as moves between different neighborhoods.</li>

            For instance, on the left you see a risk area marked on the map. Every resident of San Francisco will tell you that 6th and 7th street between the Caltrain and Market st. are places where there’s a large number of homeless people. The San Francisco Library near Market street and the food services nearby as well as 101 create an environment that has been friendly to homeless people ever since the 70s. When driving through there you’d need to be extra careful and expecting people to jump unexpectedly in front of your car at any point.
