Shared Prosperity: An "Inclusion Rider" to Hire Those Whose Jobs Will be Impact Most by the Adoption of AVs</h2>
            <hr class="my-4">
            <div>
              Evidence suggests that marginalized groups like non-English speakers in the U.S. will be hit hardest by the adoption of autonomous vehicles, since they are often employed to a disproportionate degree in the taxi and trucking industries, which each face considerable risk of disruption. As good community members, the AV industry could employ an "inclusion rider," which is roughly (in this context) a promise to hire those who have been impacted most by the incoming technology. Using the system outlined above, marginalized groups could be re-employed to participate in the development of the safety-infrastructure we have just proposed. Little training will be needed, for instance, to help propagate the Shared Semantic Space that enables "Community Mode" with useful, common-sense tags and categories that help to predict and prevent accidents. In NYC, no one would know this data better than cab drivers. The resulting data-set could be organized as a data-trust, which would ensure that contributors participated in revenue gained for its exploitation via a co-operative license.

            <div>
When an AV is involved in an accident, who should arrive on scene to assess what went wrong? Neither sheriffs nor police in the U.S. are currently trained to understand the technical systems at use in AV, which limits the extent to which they can meaningfully contribute to the improvement of these technologies. To ensure a high level of safety, we recommend that policymakers borrow from the U.S. airline industry's successful accident reporting system, which recorded zero fatalities in 2017 amongst major commercial airlines. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), in partnership with the FAA, currently uses a 'Go-Team' model that employs a rotating task-force of 8-12 experts trained in technical, policy, social-science, media, forensic, and community management matters. The multi-faceted quantitative and qualitative data that this task-force generates feeds back to industry stakeholders to improve airline safety and to inform government stakeholders so they can improve the relevant infrastructure, such as Air Traffic Control systems. This task-force or "Go-Team" model could scale as needed to rapidly improve on and then sustain AV safety. On the other hand, without a coordination mechanism of this type, the public would effectively have to carry the burden of risk that accompanies errors that manufacturers unknowingly share. This is an unsustainable model that may hamper the adoption of AVs by multiplying the total number of accidents by the number of industry players involved. A lightweight, coordinated system like the one we propose would improve outcomes while protecting IP by containing it within a small group of experts.

            <hr class="my-4">
            <div>
<p>Today, in California, when an autonomous vehicle crashes, it is the responsibility of a police officer or sheriff to report the accident using a paper form. We propose that accident reporting be brought into the 21st century. Go-Teams, for example, could be trained to interface with vehicles' data to ensure that the right information reaches the right stakeholders and that IP is not infringed upon any further than is necessary to ensure public safety (a sliding scale which can be set and reset). <br />"Community Mode": A Model for How to Share Responsibility Between Industry and the Public
</p>
<p>When a blizzard strikes in Boston, Air Traffic Control coordinates safety procedures on behalf of the airline industry. This coordination mechanism during an outlier event benefits all involved. We explore a similar if more lightweight system for AVs. Our model builds on the notion of a Shared Semantic Space, which is the area of overlap in the virtual environments that AVs use to judge the world around them. When rendered visually, this Semantic Space is often populated with purple, red, and green squares that symbolize, for an AV, cars, cyclists, pedestrians etc. To improve safety, we propose to provide vehicles access to a new common layer of Semantic Space populated by features identified by communities as risks in their area. To access this layer of contextual data, an AV would enter "Community Mode" (a play on Tesla's "Ludicruous Mode"). In Phoenix, for example, community advocates might flag a highway area in which homeless people are known to walk at night. In "Community Mode," AVs could access this geolocated data as well as other features that figure universally in larger contexts (ex. in America, a skateboard on the street often means that a child at play is nearby). "Community Mode" would create jobs, improve AV safety, and act as a catch-all for relevant findings generated by Go-Teams.

            <div>
              Today, in California, when an autonomous vehicle crashes, it is the responsibility of a police officer or sheriff to report the accident using a paper form called an OL-316. Given how much data is left unexamined in the vehicle under this model, the use of a paper record is a bit like sending a webpage through a fax machine; interoperability and data quality are abandoned wholesale! With respect paid to the intellectual property protections of each AV manufacturer, we propose that accident reporting be brought into the 21st century. Go-Teams, for example, could be trained to interface with vehicles' data to ensure that the right information reaches the right stakeholders and that IP is not infringed upon any further than is necessary to ensure public safety (a sliding scale which can be set and reset).
