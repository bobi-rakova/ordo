                <div>
No one can predict with certainty the full set of potential errors that AVs will encounter when put to use on public roads. To avoid preventable harms, foster public trust, and enable innovation, we propose to have all-parties agree to share data related to the first 500 incidents involving an AV and a fatality. As part of this pact, stakeholders would benefit from blameless, fact-driven accident reporting as well as certain liability and intellectual property protections. This proposal builds on the wildly successful model used by the NTSB in aviation, under which "Anybody’s accident is everybody’s accident" and on the International Space Station, in which <b>"One mistake is everybody's mistake"</b>.

            <hr class="light my-4">
            <div>
              What should a driving test for AVs look like?
              How do we offer multiple stages of certification considering the complexity of the technology and the difficulty of the driving task in real world environments.
              We propose a peer review process that aims to provide asnwers to these questions by utilizing the growing field of Causality and Bayesian Inference.
              Our safety certification program builds on the idea that innumerable accidents can be prevented over the long term by having different AV products compete against each other to pass certain tests.
              <!-- <p>
When an AV is involved in an accident, who should arrive on scene to assess what went wrong? Neither sheriffs nor police in the U.S. are currently trained to understand the technical systems at use in AV, which limits the extent to which they can meaningfully contribute to the improvement of these technologies. To ensure a high level of safety, we recommend that policymakers borrow from the U.S. airline industry's successful accident reporting system, which recorded zero fatalities in 2017 amongst major commercial airlines. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), in partnership with the FAA, currently uses a 'Go-Team' model that employs a rotating task-force of 8-12 experts trained in technical, policy, social-science, media, forensic, and community management matters. The multi-faceted quantitative and qualitative data that this task-force generates feeds back to industry stakeholders to improve airline safety and to inform government stakeholders so they can improve the relevant infrastructure, such as Air Traffic Control systems. This task-force or "Go-Team" model could scale as needed to rapidly improve on and then sustain AV safety. On the other hand, without a coordination mechanism of this type, the public would effectively have to carry the burden of risk that accompanies errors that manufacturers unknowingly share. This is an unsustainable model that may hamper the adoption of AVs by multiplying the total number of accidents by the number of industry players involved. A lightweight, coordinated system like the one we propose would improve outcomes while protecting IP by containing it within a small group of experts.

Shared Prosperity: An "Inclusion Rider" to Hire Those Whose Jobs Will be Most Impacted by the Adoption of AVs</h2>
            <hr class="my-4">
            <div>
              Evidence suggests that marginalized groups like non-English speakers in the U.S. will be hit hardest by the adoption of autonomous vehicles, since they are often employed to a disproportionate degree in the taxi and trucking industries, which each face considerable risk of disruption. As good community members, the AV industry could employ an "inclusion rider," which is roughly (in this context) a promise to hire those who have been impacted most by the incoming technology. Using the system outlined above, marginalized groups could be re-employed to participate in the development of the safety-infrastructure we have just proposed. Little training will be needed, for instance, to help propagate the Shared Semantic Space that enables "Community Mode" with useful, common-sense tags and categories that help to predict and prevent accidents. In NYC, no one would know this data better than cab drivers. The resulting data-set could be organized as a data-trust, which would ensure that contributors participated in revenue gained for its exploitation via a co-operative license.
